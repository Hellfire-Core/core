# Hellfire Project
hellfire is a educational and hobby project dedicated to creating a world-class MMORPG framework. 

Originally based on code from the MaNGOS and Trinity projects, cherry pick good codes from cmangos, Hellground, OregonCore, Skyfire and VMaNGOS. focusing on to support the legacy TBC patch 2.4.3, including 2.5.2 TBC Classic. 

### Currently supported builds
- 2.4.3.8606(native support)
- 2.5.2.40892(through HermesProxy)

### Project guidelines
- Accuracy: The point of an emulator is to recreate the functionality of that which it is emulating as closely as possible. Therefore any custom behaviour should be behind a config option and off by default.
- DB Scripting: Content should be separate from the core itself, so hardcoding scripts should be avoided where possible. When database scripting functionality is insufficient, we simply expand it.
- Full progression: TBD
- Tools are great: Content creation should not require programming knowledge. We hope to eventually provide tools that allow for user-friendly editing of database scripts and content, with all data presented in human-readable form.
