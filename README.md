# Hellfire Project
[Hellfire](https://github.com/Hellfire-Core/core/blob/main/docs/mvs1dl2p-1920.png?raw=true)


hellfire is a educational and hobby project dedicated to creating a world-class MMORPG framework. 

Originally based on code from the MaNGOS and Trinity projects, cherry pick good codes from cmangos, Hellground, OregonCore, Skyfire and VMaNGOS. focusing on to support the legacy TBC patch 2.4.3, including 2.5.2 TBC Classic. 

### Project vision
Our goal is to create the most convenient, most modular and most stable system:
- most convenient: rely on the advanced github workflow, we generate binary and repack which you can just download-and-play with the latest fixes. we hope everyone can enjoy this by different degree, from kids who knows 0 programming to coding experts.

- most modular: by implanting the dual-scripting module system, we hope to make custom scripting as convenient as possible.
- most stable: based on MaNGOS and few other known success big TBC servers, we hope to make it as stable as possible, example 0 crash/restarts within one week maintenance frame.

### Currently supported builds
- 2.4.3.8606(native support)
