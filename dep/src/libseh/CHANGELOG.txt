Changes:

v0.0.4:
	* Filter expressions are now evaluated outside the normal context of
	  execution.  Specifically, the esp register is set such that any function
	  calls *should* not overwrite the existing call stack, but access to
	  local variables within the scope of the __try/__except pair is
	  preserved.  Code using this library should NOT be compiled with GCC's
	  -fomit-frame-pointer flag!
	* As a result of the previous, the internal exception handler is now able 
	  to postpone the calling of __finally blocks until an appropriate
	  exception handler is found as evaluating filter expressions *should* not
	  clobber the stack data of functions with frames further down the stack.
	* The default SEH keywords have been changed to avoid conflict with
	  libstdc++'s usage of __try.  The new symbols are __seh_try,
	  __seh_except, __seh_finally, __seh_end_except, and __seh_end_finally.
	  These definitions are now present in common/config.h.
	* Support for __leave has been added.  It exists by default as
	  __seh_leave.
	* For the C++ component, exception classes have been added for the most
	  common exceptions (most exceptions with an exception code macro in the
	  PSDK beginning with EXCEPTION_).  
	* Some additional tests have been added.
	* SEH emulation using POSIX signals has been removed.

v0.0.3:
	* Apparently, the previous change to the positioning of __label__
      declarations broke compatibility with GCC 3.x.  

v0.0.2:
	* Apparently GCC 4.x treats __label__ statements differently, which would not allow the test
	  programs to compile.  This has been fixed.

v0.0.1:
	* Initial public release.
