/*
 * __libseh_register: registers give __libseh_buf object, while initializing it at 
 *                    the same time.
 *
 * Parameters: in __libseh_buf*: Address of __libseh_buf object which must be located
 *                               on the stack.
 *
 * Return value: 0 if returning from this function, or 1 if returning from 
 *               __libseh_restore_context.
 *
 * Notes: This function implements a setjmp style non-local jump.  It may even
 *        be possible to use setjmp itself here, though that would not save one 
 *        from platform specific details.
 *
 *        The __libseh_buf structure is a superset of the EXCEPTION_REGISTRATION 
 *        type used normally to register an exception handler.  Microsoft C
 *        also uses an extended version of this structure to implement SEH
 *        in the compiler.
 *
 *        %fs:0 is the first double word in the thread information block.  
 *        A linked-list of exception handler registration blocks is formed here,
 *        with %fs:0 pointing to the most recently added handler.
